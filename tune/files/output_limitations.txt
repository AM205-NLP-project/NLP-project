1: Example: Studying at Harvard is hard. However it is also a bit priviledge because  we have only a very limited number of undergraduates—which means that there is an ongoing discussion about how to improve our own access to information on the Internet.
2: Example: Studying at Harvard is hard. However it is also a bit priviledge because  the students are so immersed in the academic world that it is hard to go back and look at them from that perspective in the same way that a lot of professors come back and find out that they are doing interesting stuff.

3: Example: Studying at Harvard is hard. However it is also a bit priviledge because  there is a lot of talk about academic study—some of it academic.
4: Example: Studying at Harvard is hard. However it is also a bit priviledge because  most academic institutes in the United States have limited resources, so many of which are devoted to studying African-Americans and white Americans.
5: Example: Studying at Harvard is hard. However it is also a bit priviledge because  there is not an academic institution that can offer any meaningful degree programs. For example, if I were to teach any seminar at Harvard, I would have to travel thousands of miles to get there. It would be tedious.
6: Example: Studying at Harvard is hard. However it is also a bit priviledge because  it is so often the students that earn the bulk of their money from it — those who study in universities, the kind of professors who are not beholden to the elite and often do not have a strong social conscience or professional background.
